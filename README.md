Super Resolution of images to improve details - SRGAN

SRGAN stands for Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network. It is a deep learning-based approach for generating high-resolution images from low-resolution images.

The main objective of SRGAN is to improve the quality of low-resolution images by generating corresponding high-resolution images that are visually realistic and contain finer details. The approach is based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, which comprises a generator network and a discriminator network.

The generator network learns to map low-resolution images to high-resolution images, while the discriminator network learns to distinguish between the generated high-resolution images and real high-resolution images. During training, the generator network learns to generate high-resolution images that are realistic enough to fool the discriminator network.

The SRGAN has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets for image super-resolution and has been used in a variety of applications such as medical imaging, video processing, and computer vision.
